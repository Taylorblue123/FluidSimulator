            This project presents the design and implementation of a fluid simulator based on the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method. SPH is a Lagrangian mesh-free particle method widely used for simulating fluid dynamics. Our simulator models fluid behavior by discretizing the fluid into a set of particles, each carrying properties like mass, density, velocity, and pressure. We implement core SPH algorithms including neighborhood searching, density estimation, pressure force calculation, and viscosity effects. The simulator support direct paramter tuning, user interactions with bounding box, and flow visualization with color. We demonstrate the capabilities of our simulator through various scenarios, showcasing realistic fluid motion and interactions. The main implementation follows the proposed approach by MÃ¼ller et al. (2003), adopting its formula and different kernal functions for calculating quantities. We also adopt some parallel programming techniques with GPU and  use optimized data structure for improving performance.

            This report presents an SPH-based fluid simulator capable of visually plausible real-time 2D/3D fluid simulations. The simulator explores various SPH formulations, efficient neighbor-search techniques, and leverages parallel computing to achieve interactive frame rates. It outlines theoretical foundations, implementation details, achieved results, and discusses potential improvements.

        <h2 class="title is-3">Motivation</h2>
        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          <p>
            The project originated from exploring immersive particle cloud interactions in virtual reality (VR). Inspired by this, the idea emerged to create a similar immersive experience but with fluid simulations enhanced by haptic feedback. Initially, the project aimed to implement a fast and interactive fluid simulator using Unity, Meta Quest SDK, and GPU programming. However, the limited timeframe and steep learning curve required for mastering this complex tech stack posed significant challenges. Consequently, the project goals were revised toward a more achievable scope: leveraging familiar technologies such as C++, OpenGL, and CUDA to develop an interactive fluid simulation demo.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="title is-3">Background: Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics</h2>
        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          <p>
            Fluid simulation is a widely studied area in physics-based modeling, rendering, and animation. Traditional approaches include Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), Grid-Based Methods (Eulerian), FLIP (Fluid-Implicit Particle), and Position-Based Dynamics (PBD). Grid-based methods simulate fluid using fixed grids with physical properties. While they provide high physical accuracy (e.g., solving the Poisson equation), they are computationally expensive for real-time applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            In contrast, particle-based methods (SPH and PBD) simulate fluids using discrete particles that carry physical properties and interact through forces or positional constraints. These methods offer flexibility in interacting with objects, adaptable resolution, and are parallel-friendly, although they trade off some physical accuracy. FLIP is a hybrid method that uses particles for advection and grids for solving fluid equations. While it combines the strengths of both approaches, it is more complex to implement.
          </p>
          <p>
            After reviewing current literature, we believe that particle-based methods are better suited for scenarios requiring real-time performance, such as VR. The most representative work is by MÃ¼ller et al., <em>Particle-Based Fluid Simulation for Interactive Applications</em>, which provided a general framework that guided the implementation of our project.
          </p>
          <p>
            SPH was initially developed for astrophysical applications but has since become widely adopted in computer graphics. Key concepts include:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Particle Discretization:</strong> The fluid is represented by a collection of particles, each carrying physical quantities such as position, velocity, density, pressure, and viscosity.</li>
              <li><strong>Kernel Functions:</strong> Physical quantities at any point are estimated by summing the contributions of neighboring particles, weighted by a smoothing kernel (e.g., Poly6, Spiky).</li>
            </ul>

        <h2 class="title is-3">Method and Implementation Details</h2>
        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          <p>
            Given the SPH framework, our simulator models fluid behavior by integrating particle positions and velocities under the influence of viscosity, pressure, and external forces (e.g., gravity). For simplicity, we currently ignore fluid advection. Our SPH simulator was implemented in C++ using OpenGL for rendering, GLM for mathematical operations, and CUDA Thrust for parallel sorting. Key components of the implementation include:
          </p>
          <h3 class="title is-4">Particle Representation</h3>
          <p>
            Each particle stores its position, velocity, mass, density, pressure, and accumulated forces. We use a customized SphereBV data structure to hold these quantities along with the associated mesh. A lathe-based mesh generator is implemented to create sphere meshes with configurable complexity. The <code>SimulatorWorld</code> class maintains an array of all SphereBVs.
          </p>
          <h3 class="title is-4">Neighbor Searching</h3>
          <p>
            Efficient neighbor search is critical for SPH. Following Nvidiaâs guidance on GPU-accelerated particle simulation, we implemented a uniform grid-based method that performs parallel sorting of particles by their spatial cell ID. Since the smoothing length (<code>h</code>) defines a particleâs neighborhood, we only need to examine the 3x3 cells surrounding any given point. This reduces neighbor search complexity from O(N) to O(K), where K is the number of particles in neighboring cells.
          </p>
          <p>
            In our implementation, we maintain two precomputed buffers: a sorted <code>SpatialLookup</code> array containing (particle index, cell key) pairs, and a <code>startIndices</code> array indicating where particles begin for each cell key. In real-world tests, this optimization improved the simulator's frame rate from 8 FPS to 30 FPS for 500 particles using CPU-only computation.
          </p>
          <div class="has-text-centered">
            <img src="./static/videos/image 2.png" alt="Neighbor Searching Data Structure" style="width:709px; margin:1em auto;">
            <p class="caption">Neighbor Searching Data Structure</p>
          </div>

          <h3 class="title is-4">Predicted Schema</h3>
          <p>
            To mitigate instability caused by discretization in numerical integration, we adopt a widely-used technique known as the predicted schema. We first apply gravity to predict each particleâs next position and velocity. These predicted values are then used for density, pressure, and viscosity computations.
          </p>

          <h3 class="title is-4">SPH Computations</h3>
          <p>
            The core simulation loop involves:
            <ol>
              <li>Updating the spatial grid/hash for neighbor searching.</li>
              <li>For each particle:
                <ul>
                  <li>Calculating density based on neighbors (using the Poly6 kernel).</li>
                  <li>Calculating pressure from density (using the predicted positions).</li>
                  <li>Calculating pressure forces (using the gradient of the Spiky kernel).</li>
                  <li>Calculating viscosity forces (e.g., using the Laplacian of the viscosity kernel).</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Integrating particle positions and velocities (using Euler, Verlet, or RK4 integration).</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <h3 class="title is-4">Parallel Acceleration</h3>
          <p>
            In our first version, we simply serially perform the simulation with CPU. It turns out to be a terrible idea and has a very low FPS (Lower than 5). Then we searched for some parallel programming techniques such as multi-threading and mult-processing. After watching some tutorials, we learned that there are three tech stack for achieving this: CPU-acceleration (C++ Multithreading), GPU-accleration (CUDA or Compute Shader). Due to the steep learning curves, for now we just implement some CPU multhreading techniques using OpenOMP library for loop operation and CUDA thrust library for parallel sorting. In the future, we hope we could improve the current performance further by moving all currently CPU multithreading loops to CUDA kernals, and implement GPU instancing rendering with compute shader. Not hard to achieve!
          </p>
          <h3 class="title is-4">Boundary Handling</h3>
          <p>
            Solid boundary interactions are handled by reflecting particle velocities upon collision. Initially, we included rigid body collision code to simulate interaction with external objects (e.g., a VR hand using rigid mini spheres). However, since our current demo does not support fluid-object interaction, that code was removed to improve real-time performance.
          </p>
          <h3 class="title is-4">Rendering</h3>
          <p>
            Currently, particles are rendered as shaded spheres using OpenGL. Future improvements include implementing more advanced techniques like point splatting or marching cubes for enhanced realism.
          </p>
          <h3 class="title is-4">User Input</h3>
          <p>
            The simulator includes a basic user interface. Users can adjust simulation parameters and manipulate bounding boxes in real time. Camera movement is supported via WASD keys and mouse controls.

            During implementation, we spent extra time figuring out which tech stack to use and jumping around between using Unity with Compute Shader & Meta Quest SDK and simply implement in C++ environment with OpenGL. We actually have multiple experiment on learning Unity Pipeline with Compute Shader, but still have a lot of unresolved bugs and issues. For example, how to integrate Meta Quest OpenXR SDK with our real-time fluid simulation using GPU object instancing rendering? Since the normal customized instancing shader is generally for monocular rendering. How to implement a rendering pipeline for binocular rendering with customized shader? It is a vital to figure out.

            Due to the limited time, for now we just implement the simulator using pure C++ environment. And we also spent a lot of time fine tuning and find optimization way for both physical accuracy and real-time performance. At first we are so frustrated that having a thousand of chaotic particles jumping around, it doesnât like fluid at all! Then we read some techniques including predicted schema and adding diffusion force to get a smoother fluid (At least like fluid!). During a lot of time spent on fine tuning, we randomly found that verlet integration also stabilize the fluid. Finally we get a relatively plausible fluid! For performance optimization, we spent some time figuring out the use of multithreading and cuda environment. But still leave a huge space for future improvement.

            Although eventually we implement a plausible fluid simulation demo based on SPH method. There are multiple things to do from refractoring current code, adding extra features to performance accleration and VR Setup.

          <h3 class="title is-4">Refactoring Code</h3>
          <p>
            The current design stems from a previous rigid body dynamics assignment. All physical quantities are encapsulated in the <code>SphereBV</code> object. However, this structure presents challenges for GPU optimization due to data races when multiple threads modify the same object. We addressed some issues using memory padding, but a more scalable solution requires redesigning data layout for GPU parallelism.

            In the future, we would rewrite the whole simulator code when we transfer simulation and rendering to GPU with kernal functions.
          </p>
          <h3 class="title is-4">Adding Interaction Features</h3>
          <p>
            Currently, users can only move or rotate bounding boxes. We plan to add a large interactive sphere that disturbs the fluid using repulsive forces or rigid body dynamics. In a VR environment, users will be able to manipulate this sphere with their hands, potentially with haptic feedback.
          </p>
          <h3 class="title is-4">Performance Optimization</h3>
          <p>
            As discussed above, we intend to fully migrate simulation and rendering to the GPU using CUDA or compute shaders. Additional improvements may include more realistic lighting and optimized data structures for large-scale simulations.
